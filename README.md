# HashMatchingProject

This Project was developed by a group of two students of Computer Engeneering at University Fernando Pessoa;

We developed a program that given a file of hashes and non-encrypted passwords it encrypts the passwords and compares to the file of hashes that you have.

It was created for the Distributed Systems subject so it is a Distributed System program. It has a Server and a Client and the work can divided by different clients.
